Hello, #. What business do you have here? If you have a moment to spare, could you help me? Our fortress has been destroyed by our enemies, and we're looking for resources to rebuild it. I'd be very grateful if you could get us some $.
О, #. It's been a long time! You're right on time, as always. There's a big construction job going on about five versts away, and we really need resources! We'd better be able to build the fort before winter, we really need to get some $ for that. Can you help with that?
Greetings, #! My family has managed to get out of poverty in the last five years - my sister has started her own business, and her shop is in good demand! If you'd like to be our supplier, I'm sure you'd have $ to sell.
Hi, #! Even though we don't know each other, I hope you won't refuse me a favor. My sister is getting married, and we're actively collecting her dowry right now. We're almost done, now we just need to find $. Help us with that, and I'll pay you back generously.
Good day, #! It's so good to see you. I'm going to my friend's birthday party now, and, horribly, I'm going there empty-handed. Maybe you have some $? I definitely won't have time to sort it out in the next two hours, and I have to hurry.
#, I need your help right away! My dad was camping in the woods and hunting a bear with a burning pole. Anyway, the bear caught fire and ran off into the woods. In the chase, the father got lost and lost his tent and junk. There was $ in the tent. We really need that stuff, please help us get it back.
Oh-ho-ho, #. My grandmother was a witch and taught me various tricks as a child. Would you like me to show you one? Bring me some $. I'll wave my hand and it will all disappear and coins will appear out of nowhere and fall at your feet.
